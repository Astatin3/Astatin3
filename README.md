Hello!


I am a 16 year old developer, I know WAY too much about Minecraft, and I "Do Programming" in all kinds of things including cybersecurity, robotics, photogrammetry, and statistics for some reason.
I'm a team member of an FRC robotics team, [Ridgebotics](https://www.ridgebotics.com/), in which I am the [Scouting](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/team-resources/frc_intro_scouting.pdf) lead for the team. 
I use Java and Python for almost all the things that I do, but I can force myself through other languages when I have to.
